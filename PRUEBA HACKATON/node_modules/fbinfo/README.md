# Description
Pulls down publicly available information for a given Facebook profile - useful for finding a Facebook ID from a username.

# Installation
```
npm install fbinfo
```

# Usage
If called without any parameters, it will prompt you for username to lookup, otherwise it'll take the first argument as a username and attempt to lookup using that.

## Example
```
fbinfo zuck
```

Will return
```YAML
id: 4
name: Mark Zuckerberg
first_name: Mark
last_name: Zuckerberg
link: http://www.facebook.com/zuck
username: zuck
gender: male
locale: en_US
```

Likewise the same information could be brought back using
```
fbinfo 4
```
Where "4" is the Facebook ID of a user (in this case, Mark Zuckerberg)
